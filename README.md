# Weather App

## Simple weather app

Built more on a technical point of view rather then design

### Installation

Simple as:

`git clone https://github.com/krystian-mw/weather`
or
`npm i krystian-mw/weather`

and then of course:

`npm i`

#### Important

The `sample.env` file has to be cloned, modified and renamed to `.env` as important api keys are required.

### Usage

`npm start` - starts the dev server

`npm run-script build` - compiles a version to the `dist` folder

### Changelog

Addressed issues: #1, #2 and #4

### Example
